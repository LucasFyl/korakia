Text: Enjoy a swim in one of our two heated (depending on seasonality) salt water pools with views of the San Jacinto Mountains.  The picturesque Moroccan pool is nestled in the courtyard of the Moroccan villa with beautiful architecture. The pool is beautifully designed with a stone infinity edge and surrounded by fire pits. Our relaxing pools are open 24 hours to our guest. Travel and Leisure Magazine named the Mediterranean pool "One of the Sexiest pools in the World."
