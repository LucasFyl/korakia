Welcome to a romantic retreat unlike any other. Korakia Pensione offers a unique and relaxing getaway from day to day reality. Crafted after a Mediterranean-style pensione, Korakia blends the silhouette of Tangier with a whisper of the Mediterranean.

Begin the day with a complimentary full-cooked breakfast in the Moroccan courtyard. Soothe your soul poolside, seek healing through yoga or pamper yourself with our spa offerings. Curl up with a vintage book from the library lounge. Join a game of bocce ball or explore downtown Palm Springs on one of our complimentary bicycles. Relax and refresh with the Moroccan tea service each afternoon.

Lanterns and fire-pits flicker, illuminating the heated pools at night. Classic and foreign films glimmer on a nearby screen. A Moroccan daybed beckons for stargazing. Nightly turn-downs are done in the European tradition.

Come and see why Forbes Traveler named Korakia one of the “Sexiest Hotels in America.”

Firsttext: 

J. Carol Naish, an early silent-screen star and neighbor to Coutts, owned the 1930's Mediterranean villa. The Naish property blends the charm of Southern Europe with North African accents throughout its structure. The main house boasts an impossibly romantic master suite, high wood beam ceilings, an indoor/outdoor bathroom and a massive fireplace.

Using a variety of textures and colors, the outdoor area of the Naish property lends an exotic feel to its poolside experience. Within the sun-drenched pool area itself, the villa and bungalows' exterior walls greet visitors with a vivid blend of earth-tone hues, that range from deep ocher, rusts to tawny yellows and stone.

The Orchard House is a rare 1918 California adobe. Two 1940s steel windows have been welded together to create a dramatic pivoting window wall. The whitewashed stone wall encloses a grove of citrus trees.
